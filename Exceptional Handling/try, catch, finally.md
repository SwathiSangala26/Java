## 🟢 Definition

* Exception handling is a mechanism to **handle runtime errors**
* Prevents **abnormal termination** of program
* Maintains **normal flow of execution**
* Implemented using:

  * `try`
  * `catch`
  * `finally`

---

## 🟢 What is an Exception?

* An exception is an **unexpected event at runtime**
* Occurs during program execution
* Causes program disruption if not handled

Examples:

* Divide by zero
* Null reference access
* Invalid array index
* File not found

---

## 🟢 `try` Block

* Contains **risky code**
* JVM monitors this block
* If exception occurs:

  * Remaining code in `try` is skipped
  * Control moves to `catch`

Syntax:

```java
try {
    // risky code
}
```

Rules:

* `try` cannot exist alone
* Must be followed by `catch` or `finally`
* Cannot have code outside blocks

---

## 🟢 `catch` Block

* Handles exception thrown from `try`
* Executes only when exception occurs
* Prevents program crash

Syntax:

```java
catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // handling code
}
```

Key points:

* Exception type must match
* If not matched → JVM checks next `catch`
* If none matches → program terminates

---

## 🟢 `finally` Block

* Executes **always**
* Executes whether exception occurs or not
* Used for **cleanup code**

Syntax:

```java
finally {
    // cleanup code
}
```

Common uses:

* Closing files
* Closing database connections
* Releasing resources

---

## 🟢 Complete try–catch–finally Example

```java
try {
    int a = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Divide by zero");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup");
}
```

Execution:

* Exception occurs
* `catch` executes
* `finally` executes
* Program continues

---

## 🟢 Execution Flow

### No Exception

* `try` executes fully
* `catch` skipped
* `finally` executes

### Exception Occurs and Caught

* `try` stops at exception
* Matching `catch` executes
* `finally` executes

### Exception Occurs and Not Caught

* `try` stops
* `finally` executes
* Program crashes

---

## 🟢 Important `finally` Rules

* Executes even if `return` is used
* Executes even if exception is thrown
* Does NOT execute if:

  * `System.exit()` is called
  * JVM crashes

Avoid:

```java
finally {
    return value;
}
```

Reason:

* Overrides return value from `try` or `catch`

---

## 🟢 Multiple `catch` Blocks

* Used to handle **different exception types**
* JVM checks `catch` blocks **top to bottom**
* First matching block executes

Syntax:

```java
try {
    // risky code
} catch (ExceptionType1 e) {
    // handle
} catch (ExceptionType2 e) {
    // handle
}
```

---

## 🟢 Order of Multiple `catch` Blocks

Rule:

* **Child exception first**
* **Parent exception last**

Correct:

```java
catch (NullPointerException e) { }
catch (Exception e) { }
```

Incorrect:

```java
catch (Exception e) { }
catch (NullPointerException e) { } // compile-time error
```

Reason:

* Parent catches all child exceptions
* Child becomes unreachable

---

## 🟢 Generic `catch (Exception e)`

* Handles all exceptions
* Should be placed **last**
* Used as fallback handler

Example:

```java
catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("General error");
}
```

---

## 🟢 Can We Have try Without catch?

Allowed:

```java
try {
    // code
} finally {
    // cleanup
}
```

Not Allowed:

```java
try {
    // code
}
```

Reason:

* `try` must be followed by `catch` or `finally`

---

## 🟢 Nested try–catch

* `try` inside another `try`
* Used for fine-grained exception handling

Example:

```java
try {
    try {
        int a = 10 / 0;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Inner catch");
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Outer catch");
}
```

---

## 🟢 Throwing Exception from catch

* Exception can be re-thrown
* Control moves to caller

Example:

```java
catch (Exception e) {
    throw e;
}
```

* `finally` still executes

---

## 🟢 Exception Object (`e`)

* `e` contains exception details
* Common methods:

  * `e.getMessage()`
  * `e.printStackTrace()`
