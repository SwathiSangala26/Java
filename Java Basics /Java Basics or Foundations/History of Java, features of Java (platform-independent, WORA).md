## 🟢 History of Java

* Java was developed in **1991** at **Sun Microsystems**
* The project was led by **James Gosling**
* Original project name was **Oak**
* Oak was designed for **embedded systems** (TVs, set-top boxes)

### Why Oak failed initially

* Embedded systems market did not grow as expected
* Oak was too heavy for small devices at that time

---

### Birth of Java

* In **1995**, Oak was renamed to **Java**
* Java was redesigned for:

  * Internet
  * Web applications
  * Network-based systems
* First public version released as **Java 1.0**

---

### Growth of Java

* Java became popular due to:

  * Web applets
  * Platform independence
  * Strong security model
* Widely adopted in:

  * Enterprise applications
  * Banking systems
  * Web servers
  * Mobile (Android later)

---

### Java Today

* Sun Microsystems was acquired by **Oracle** in **2010**
* Java is now maintained and released by **Oracle**
* Used in:

  * Backend systems
  * Cloud applications
  * Big data
  * Android development
  * Enterprise software

## 🟢 Features of Java

Java was designed with several key features that make it powerful and popular.

---

## 🟢 Platform Independent

* Java programs are **not dependent on any operating system**
* Java code can run on:

  * Windows
  * Linux
  * macOS
  * Any system with JVM

### How this works

* Java source code (`.java`) is compiled into **bytecode** (`.class`)
* Bytecode is executed by **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
* JVM is platform-specific
* Bytecode is platform-independent

---

## 🟢 WORA – Write Once, Run Anywhere

* Java follows the principle **WORA**
* Same compiled Java program can run on multiple platforms
* No need to rewrite code for different operating systems

### Example

* Compile Java code once
* Run it on Windows JVM
* Run the same `.class` file on Linux JVM

---

## 🟢 Object-Oriented

* Java follows **OOP principles**
* Supports:

  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
  * Abstraction
* Helps in:

  * Code reusability
  * Maintainability
  * Modularity

---

## 🟢 Simple

* Java syntax is similar to C/C++
* Removes complex features like:

  * Multiple inheritance using classes
  * Pointer arithmetic
* Automatic memory management using **Garbage Collector**

---

## 🟢 Secure

* No direct access to memory (no pointers)
* Bytecode verification before execution
* Strong exception handling
* Security manager controls access to system resources

---

## 🟢 Robust

* Strong type checking
* Compile-time and runtime error checking
* Automatic garbage collection
* Exception handling mechanism

---

## 🟢 Portable

* Fixed-size primitive data types
* Same behavior across platforms
* No platform-dependent features

---

## 🟢 Multithreaded

* Supports multiple threads of execution
* Improves performance
* Used heavily in server-side applications

---

## 🟢 High Performance

* Uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**
* Converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime
* Faster than traditional interpreted languages

---

## 🟢 Distributed

* Supports distributed computing
* Provides APIs for:

  * Networking
  * RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
  * Web services

---

## 🟢 Architecture-Neutral

* Bytecode is independent of hardware architecture
* Same bytecode runs on different CPUs
